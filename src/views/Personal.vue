      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>
        These are some of the personal projects I've been working on over the
        years. I tried calling this category "Visual", "Other", "Misc" and so
        on. As you will find out by reading further, I'm not that great at
        naming these things. What differs these projects from other things on
        this site is that I made these purely for myself and they turned out
        pretty nice.

        <h3>VW-project</h3>
        <p>
          In early 2022 I got into learning about video synthesisers and
          feedback loops. As a result, here's a
          <a href="https://vw.topiassaari.com/">collection of videos</a>
          combining those. I update the site as I do more. What you see and hear
          is a combination of video synthesis, found footage, video mixing,
          generative and sequenced audio as well as anything else that might be
          of interest for the day. Honestly if you are interested in me as a
          potential employee, the chance of this project being targeted for you
          is fairly low. Well also if you are a friend...the chance of this
          being for you is still pretty low. If it does happen to be something
          you enjoy or want to work on, please contact me and we can figure
          something out together. BE WARNED, A LOT OF FLASHING LIGHTS AND LOUD
          SOUNDS.

        <h3>P-project</h3>
        <p>
          Despite working on this project for almost six years, I never got
          around to actually naming it. In 2017 I began drawing on the photos
          I've taken. This turned into around 300 files named "P123" etc. P
          stands for "picture". Few of the images ended up being framed on the
          walls of my friends, a couple were even album covers. I made a book
          that's really fancy, but unfortunately there's only a handful of
          copies and I don't have the resources to make more. You can see some
          of the images in this
          <a href="http://gallery.topiassaari.com/">gallery</a>, as well as my
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/topias/">instagram</a>.
