        Among the event photography, I've been involved in a handful of video
        projects. Usually behind the camera. These are a selected few that I
        really like.

          personally I think every time they get better.

        <h3>Poets of the Fall - Moonlight Kissed</h3>
        <p>
          Music video for Poets of the Fall where for some weird reason I ended
          up being the grip assist / runner. I mostly got everyone coffee, but
          since the video has over 2m views, so its pretty funny to add here.
